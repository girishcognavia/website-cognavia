## How It Works

### Step 1: Configure Your Repository

Point CognaFileSearch to your existing document repository - whether it's a local folder, network drive, or remote FTP server. The system supports various deployment configurations to match your infrastructure.

### Step 2: Batch Process Documents

Initiate the one-time batch processing to analyze your existing documents. CognaFileSearch extracts specifications from each PDF, creating a searchable index of your entire repository. Progress is tracked in real-time with detailed statistics.

### Step 3: Upload and Search

When you receive a new document or specification:
1. Upload the PDF through the intuitive interface
2. System automatically extracts specifications
3. Review extracted data and make corrections if needed
4. Execute similarity search against your repository

### Step 4: Review Matches

Receive a ranked list of similar documents with:
- Similarity percentage scores
- Field-by-field match breakdown
- Quick access to original documents
- Side-by-side comparison views

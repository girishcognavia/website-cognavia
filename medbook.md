## The Problem We Solve

### Current Challenges in Hospital Appointment Booking

**For Patients:**
- 70% of patients don't know which department or specialist to approach
- Long wait times on hospital phone lines (often 15-30 minutes)
- Language barriers - many patients prefer Hindi but staff often communicate in English
- Frustrating experience of being transferred between departments
- No 24/7 booking option - must call during business hours

**For Hospitals:**
- High call volume overwhelming front desk staff (200-500 calls/day)
- Wrong-specialty bookings waste valuable doctor time
- Inefficient resource utilization
- Poor patient satisfaction scores
- High operational costs for appointment management

## How It Works

### For Patients

**Step 1: Start a Conversation**
The patient opens the chat widget on the hospital website and selects their preferred language (English or Hindi).

**Step 2: Describe Symptoms**
The patient describes their health concern in simple words. The AI asks clarifying questions if needed to better understand the symptoms.

**Step 3: Get Doctor Recommendations**
Based on the symptoms, MediBook AI recommends the appropriate specialty and shows available doctors with their experience and consultation fees.

**Step 4: Choose a Time Slot**
The patient selects from available appointment slots displayed in an easy-to-read format, grouped by date.

**Step 5: Provide Details**
